In this game there is no predefined path, you must slow the creatures strategically to prevent them from reaching your castle. To achieve this, the player can place the towers on the ground to force the creatures to move in another path. Thus the player can determine the path that the creatures will follow.\r\n\r\n[Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/embed/yV1nRcLD3AY)\r\n![Copie d'écran](https://github.com/goupildb/asd-tower-defense/blob/gh-pages/Screenshots/ASD.jpg)\r\n![Copie d'écran2](http://goupildb.github.io/asd-tower-defense/blob/gh-pages/Screenshots/ASD.jpg)\r\n\r\n![Image of Yaktocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat.png)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
